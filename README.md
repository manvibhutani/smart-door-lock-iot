# Thief Detection System

The Thief Detection System is an Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) based project aimed at enhancing home security.

## Overview

The Thief Detection System utilizes a combination of IoT sensors and facial recognition technology to detect unauthorized individuals attempting to gain access to a secured area.

### Features

1. **Facial Detection**
    - **Description**: Utilizes a camera sensor and facial recognition algorithm to identify individuals attempting to access a secured area.
    - **Benefit**: Enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and providing real-time alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

2. **Real-Time Notification**
    - **Description**: Sends real-time notifications to the homeowner's mobile device when an unrecognized face is detected.
    - **Benefit**: Provides prompt security awareness, allowing homeowners to take immediate action to address potential security threats.

3. **Buzzer Alert**
    - **Description**: Triggers a buzzer alert when an unrecognized face is detected, alerting individuals in the vicinity to the potential security breach.
    - **Benefit**: Acts as a deterrent to unauthorized access and alerts nearby individuals to the presence of a potential intruder.
